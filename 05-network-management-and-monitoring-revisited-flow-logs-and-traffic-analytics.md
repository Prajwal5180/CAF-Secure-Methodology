# Exercise 5- Network Management and Monitoring Revisited: Flow Logs and Traffic Analytics

Network management and monitoring play a crucial role in maintaining a secure and efficient network infrastructure. In addition to traditional monitoring methods, flow logs and traffic analytics provide valuable insights into network traffic patterns and behavior.

Flow logs capture detailed information about network flows, including source and destination IP addresses, ports, protocols, and packet counts. They offer visibility into network traffic at the packet level, aiding in troubleshooting, detecting anomalies, and understanding network behavior.

Combining flow logs and traffic analytics enables network administrators to gain comprehensive visibility, streamline troubleshooting, and make data-driven decisions for network optimization and security enhancement.

This exercise includes the following tasks:

  - NSG Validation
  - Network Watcher Traffic Analytics to monitor the network
  
## **Task 1: NSG Validation (Optional)**

## **Summary**
 
In this exercise you have covered the following:
  
   - Performed NSG validation.
   - Monitored the network watcher traffic.
