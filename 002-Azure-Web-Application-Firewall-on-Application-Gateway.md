# **Exercise 2: Azure Web Application Firewall on Application Gateway**

### Overview

Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network resources. It's a fully stateful firewall as a service with built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability. To learn more about Azure Firewall refer: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall`

Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. Traditional load balancers operate at the transport layer (OSI layer 4 - TCP and UDP). To learn more about Application gateway refer: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway`

Azure Web Application Firewall provides centralized protection of your web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities. Web applications are increasingly targeted by malicious attacks that exploit commonly known vulnerabilities. SQL injection and cross-site scripting are among the most common attacks. Preventing such attacks in application code is challenging. It can require rigorous maintenance, patching, and monitoring at multiple layers of the application topology. A centralized web application firewall helps make security management much simpler. To learn more about Azure Web Application Firewall refer: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway`

In this exercise, you will deploy an Azure Firewall and Application Gateway with WAF V2 then you will publish an application through it. You'll also test the security of the application and perform a sample attack.

This exercise includes the following tasks:

  - Configure WAF to protect your web application
  - Publish your application to the internet with the application gateway
  - Monitor attacks against your web application
  - Customize WAF rules
  - Attack simulation

 ## **Task 1: Configure WAF to protect your web application**

1. Now, you can observe the total number of network traffic flows from **Traffic Visualization**

    > **Note**: The dashboard may take up to 30 minutes to appear when deployed for the first time. This is because Traffic Analytics must first aggregate enough data for it to derive meaningful insights. If it takes more time, you can perform the next task and can come back later and check on this
      
      ![traffic visualization](/images1/traffic%20visualisation.png)

      > **Note**: You will see that your website is Blocked outside the Jump VM
 
     ![ss](/images1/site.png)

 ## **Task 5: Attack simulation** 
     
In this task, you will be testing your application for security and performing sample attacks like XSS. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser-side script, to a different end-user.

   > **Note**: You can perform this task only after finishing task 2 and task 3.

1. You can perform a sample attack on your application by passing this `?q=<script>` value at the end of the web application URL or IP address.
    
1. Now pass the value `?q=<script>` at the end of your **Application Gateway** IP and try browsing it. You can observe the web application can be still accessible.
  
   > **Note**: Your browsing URL value should look like ```http://20.185.224.102/?q=<script>```
    
   ![ss](/images1/attack.png)
  
1. To make your application more secure, select **ApplicationGateway** from the overview page of the resource group.
     
   ![rp](/images1/rgappgateway.png)
    
1. Under the **Application gateway** page, follow the below details:

     ![config](/images1/webappfirewall.png)
 
1. Under the **firewallpolicy** page, go to the **Overview (1)** tab and click on **Switch to prevention mode (2)**.
 
    ![](/images1/switchtoprevention.png)
    
1. Now, navigate back to the tab where you browsed the IP Address and refresh the page. You can observe the **403 Forbidden error**.
    
    ![server error](/images1/403.png)
