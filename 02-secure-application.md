# Exercise 2- Secure application  

### Overview

Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based network security service that protects your Azure Virtual Network resources. It's a fully stateful firewall as a service with built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability. To learn more about Azure Firewall refer: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firewall`

Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. Traditional load balancers operate at the transport layer (OSI layer 4 - TCP and UDP). To learn more about Application gateway refer: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway`

Azure Web Application Firewall provides centralized protection of your web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities. Web applications are increasingly targeted by malicious attacks that exploit commonly known vulnerabilities. SQL injection and cross-site scripting are among the most common attacks. Preventing such attacks in application code is challenging. It can require rigorous maintenance, patching, and monitoring at multiple layers of the application topology. A centralized web application firewall helps make security management much simpler. To learn more about Azure Web Application Firewall refer: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway`

In this exercise, you will deploy an Azure Firewall and Application Gateway with WAF V2 then you will publish an application through it. You'll also test the security of the application and perform a sample attack.

This exercise includes the following tasks:

  - Configure WAF to protect your web application
  - Accessing your application using the application gateway
  - Application Gateway WAF Custom Rule to block IP
  - Attack simulation
  - Rate Limiting using Azure Front Door

 ## **Task 1: Configure WAF to protect your web application**
 
 In this task, you will add a Virtual Machine as the Backend pool of the Application gateway and also configure the Application Gateway from the firewall policy.
 
 1. From the Azure **Home** page, search for **Application gateways (1)** from the search bar and select **Application gateways (2)**.
 
      ![](images/searchgateway.png "search gateway")

1. Now, to test the application copy and paste the Frontend public IP address of **Application Gateway** into a new browser tab that you copied in step 4.

   ![ss](/images/image307.png)
       

 ## **Task 3: Application Gateway WAF Custom Rule to block IP**
 
In this task, you will block access from the Lab VM to the Jump VM by configuring a Firewall Policy custom rule. The rule will deny access to the web application by adding the Lab VM’s Public IP in the deny rule.
 
 1. In the Azure portal, search for **Virtual Machine (1)** and select it from the results (2).

      ![](images/a156.png "select gateway")

   ![](images/image306.png "select gateway")

1. To make your application more secure, select **ApplicationGateway** from the overview page of the resource group.
     
   ![rp](/images1/rgappgateway.png)
    
1. Under the **Application gateway** page, follow the below details:
     - Select **Web application firewall (1)** under **Settings**.    
     - Click on **firewallpolicy** under **Associated web application firewall policy (2)**.  
  
         ![config](/images1/webappfirewall.png)
 
1. Under the **firewallpolicy** page, go to the **Overview (1)** tab and click on **Switch to prevention mode (2)**.
 
    ![](/images1/switchtoprevention.png)

1. Navigate back to the browser tab where you accessed the application gateway website and **refresh** the tab; you will no longer be able to see the website.

   ![](images1/infra4.png)

   >**Note**: This may take a few minutes to take effect. 

1. Navigate back to **firewallpolicy** page, go to the **Overview (1)** tab and click on **Switch to detection mode (2)**.

   ![](images/a161.png "select gateway")

 ## **Task 4: Attack simulation** 
     
In this task, you will be testing your application for security and performing sample attacks like XSS. Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser-side script, to a different end-user.

Since we are already blocking the Public IP of the Lab VM from accessing the web application. You will want to perform this test from your own machine’s browser. You can perform a sample attack on your application by passing this `?q=<script>` value at the end of the web application URL or IP address.

1. From your own machine's browser, access the application by putting in the **Application Gateway IP** that you looked up in Task 2.
   
   >**Note**: Your browsing URL value should look like ```http://20.185.224.102```

    ![ss](/images/image307.png)

1. Now pass the value `?q=<script>` at the end of your **Application Gateway** IP and try browsing it using browser. You can observe that the web application is accessible.
  
   >**Note**: Your browsing URL value should look like ```http://20.185.224.102/?q=<script>```
    
   ![ss](/images1/attack.png)
  
1. To make your application more secure, select **ApplicationGateway** from the overview page of the resource group.
     
   ![rp](/images1/rgappgateway.png)
    
1. Under the **Application gateway** page, follow the below details:
     - Select **Web application firewall (1)** under **Settings**.    
     - Click on **firewallpolicy** under **Associated web application firewall policy (2)**.  
  
         ![config](/images1/webappfirewall.png)
 
1. Under the **firewallpolicy** page, go to the **Overview (1)** tab and click on **Switch to prevention mode (2)**.
 
    ![](/images1/switchtoprevention.png)
    
1. Now, navigate back to the tab where you browsed the IP Address and refresh the page. You can observe the **403 Forbidden error**.
    
    ![server error](/images1/403.png)

## **Task 5: Rate Limiting using Azure Front Door**
  
In this task, you will set up an Azure Front Door configuration that pools two instances of a web application that runs in different Azure regions. This configuration directs traffic to the nearest site that runs the application. Azure Front Door continuously monitors the web application. You will demonstrate automatic failover to the next available site when the nearest site is unavailable. The network configuration is shown in the following diagram:  
  
![](images/a80.png)
